Chapter is a cross-platform app that turn your best moments into memorable stories and helps you capture all points of view by collaborating with the people who were actually there.

How it works?
1) The author of the story names the Chapter (e.g. "Adventures in the Alps") and invites the people (Characters) that were or will be involved in the story.
2) Then he starts filling the Chapter with relevant content.
3) The best part comes when the invited collaborators start posting their own content. Chapter automatically orders it chronologically making it easier for the all co-authors to catch the flow of the story and fill the missing parts.
4) Finally the author of the Chapter chooses what content should be edited or removed from the story and publishes it officially in the social medias he wants. All co-authors receive notification when the Chapter was published.

The end result? 
All participants receive a memorable story of their experience for which they have personally contributed for, enabling them to see all the different points of view, that were hidden before. 

PS: We've tested the Value Proposition hypothesis by creating our own Chapter of the Hackaton and we could proudly say that the results was an EPIC FUN!
